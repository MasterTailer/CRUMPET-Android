/**
 * @brief The main move and light command interface for the tails
 *
 * The method through which commands should be sent to the tail. The idea is that
 * while such commands as battery status and versions should be sent directly,
 * a more playlist style of approach will want to be employed for the moves
 * and light commands. The command queue will allow for commands to be queued
 * up in a progressive manner, and then fired off either immediately the previous
 * one ended, or with a given pause before the next is launched. This ensures that
 * the tail will not likely end up with the kind of damage which might otherwise
 * occur if we allowed commands to simply be fired off without a cooldown period.
